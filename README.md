# LUME-DBN
Latent Uncertainty Modeling via MCMC Estimation in DBNs (LUME-DBN) is a novel Gibbs sampling-based method for learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks from incomplete data. which iteratively sample the parameters and the missing values from their Full Conditional Distribution and update the DBN structure via Metropolis Hasting moves.
